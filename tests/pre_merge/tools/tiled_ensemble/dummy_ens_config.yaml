predictions:
  storage: direct # how the predictions are stored, options: [direct, file_system, rescaled]
  rescale_factor: 0.5 # factor by which data is downscaled in case of "rescaled" storage

post_processing:
  normalization: joined_image # on what level we normalize, options: [individual_tile, joined_image, none]
  smooth_joins:
    apply: True # if this is applied, area where tile joins are is smoothed
    sigma: 2 # sigma of gaussian filter used to smooth this area
    width: 0.1 # width factor, multiplied by tile dimension gives the region which will be smoothed
